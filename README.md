# NGU
The [NGU](https://zukas97.github.io/NGU/) (New Gamer Union) is a site for playing unblocked games at School
<br />
# Note: Use Responsibly
This is meant for playing games to pass the time in school AFTER your work is done, not before.

# I am NOT a professional
I am not a professional, I am some random high-schooler. I'm not even a web developer. I learned a lot by doing this project.

# Contributing
The best way to contribute is by forking the repo, making your changes to that, and creating a pull request.
If you want to add a game, copy `template.html` and replace it's src property with the URL of your game. Then add the buttons for it on `navbar.html` and `index.html`
