# NGU
The NGU (New Gamer Union) is a site for playing unblocked games at School
<br />
# Note: Use Responsibly
This is meant for playing games to pass the time in school AFTER your work is done, not before.

# This is a Work in Progress
Sometimes it may not be working and it is currently in very early stages.
