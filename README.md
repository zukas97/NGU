# NGU
The [NGU](https://zukas97.github.io/NGU/) (New Gamer Union) is a site for playing unblocked games at School
<br />
# Note: Use Responsibly
This is meant for playing games to pass the time in school AFTER your work is done, not before.

# I am NOT a professional
I am not a professional, I am some random high-schooler. I'm not even a web developer. I learned a lot by doing this project.
